# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

The purpose of the repository is to make all the codes I have done in this class in one place. This clearly shows what coding skills I had developed from this course.

I have been given the permission to make my work public.

Project1:
The first project is all about using SQL, I renamed some columns, created new columns, updated the values replacing the old values including single value and range of values.

Project2:
I ran SQL in R using RODBC, created columns and updated some values. I also obtained counts amd merge tables using inner join in sqldf package. Other than that, I did data visualization using ggplot. 


Midterm_Project:
I ran SQL in R using RODBC, and applied data cleaning techniques to clean the data. The goal is for us to independently working on or getting used to unstructured data, in this task, we are required to find problems in this dataset, and then correct them. First, I checked tehe counts for all observations in all variables, they are all correct. Then I proceed to clean the data by renaming the variables, reassigning some "999"s into NAs, and then drop the rows with more than 35 NAs within that row. Then I replaced some of the NAs (if continuous variable) using mean imputation, I also converted the variables into right format. At the end, I unified some units (i.e: month, year).


Final_Project:
This task is required using both R and SQL, and I found this project covered a lot of materials we covered in this course. The first several parts in the first question was repetition from homeworks, and for later parts in the first question, I also experienced some difficulty because of a lot of inner joins and variability for different variables, and combined many skills at the same time. Question 2 and 3 are both about merging tables, the difference is to use SQL in question2, and R in question 3. I found that merging is easier using R, because we don't need to create many tables, R could done these less time-consuming. The last part is to post codes on GitHub. This is the first time I am using GitHub, and I feel like I am getting closer to the data science field.
